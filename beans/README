EASC (Enterprise Application Server Connectivity): Beans
========================================================================
$Id$

Getting started
---------------
Type "ant":)

Requirements
------------
- JDK 1.5
- Apache Ant

Beans
-----
In the src/net/xp_framework/beans/ subdirectory, there are a few demo 
beans for which the PHP-clients are in the clients directory (in this
directory's parent directory).

stateless/CalculatorBean.java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A simple calculator demo which shows off the following:

* Method overloading
* Value objects

entities/FeedBean.java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An entity bean for the feed table in planet-xp.net's database.

* Value objects
* Creating entities
* Modifying entities
* Selecting entities

Deploying these beans
---------------------
1) Deploy resources/syndicate-ds.xml, it is necessary for FeedBean 
   to work. 

2) Then, create the ejb-jar by typing "ant ejb-jar"

3) Finally, deploy the beans by means of make. There are two methods:
   a) Local deployment (Jboss is running on your machine):
   
      make deploy to=/usr/local/jboss4/server/all/deploy
      
      Of course, you'll have to adjust the directory to resemble your
      JBoss setup
   
   b) Remote deployment (Jboss is running on a remote machine you
      have ssh access to).
      
      make rdeploy targets=java@jboss1:~/deploy

<EOF>
